This repo contains all the information you need to start practicing for your next interview.

There are exercises for interviews from 1st and 2nd year of university.
Also for those who are going to have more advanced interviews such as SWE, they can consult their corresponding folder.

## How to use it

If you are just starting out checkout our [Newbie section](https://github.com/Club-de-Algoritmia-GDA/Interview-Practice-Roadmap/tree/master/newbie).
Else if you are applying for a SWE internship checkout our [SWE section](https://github.com/Club-de-Algoritmia-GDA/Interview-Practice-Roadmap/tree/master/swe-intern).



1. Fork this repo to your Github
2. Solve one to many exercise,  once you want us to review them go to the next step
3. Create your own branch with your Github user.
4. Push your solution(s) and create a Pull Request.
5. One staff member will review your solution(s) and give feedback.
6. Once you have implemented the feedback repeat step 4 (don't erase your previous solution(s), just add the new code on the bottom of your code, so everyone can see different approaches).
 7. Once your solution is approved we're merging your solution(s) to master branch.
 9. Repeat
 
 **Remember that practice and constancy makes the difference.**
